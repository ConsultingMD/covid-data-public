Please see the [original source](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data) for more information.\r\n\r\nAll of Our World in Data is completely open access and all work is licensed under the Creative Commons BY license. You have the permission to use, distribute, and reproduce in any medium, provided the source and authors are credited.\r\n\r\nThis data has been collected, aggregated, and documented by Diana Beltekian, Daniel Gavrilov, Charlie Giattino, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Edouard Mathieu, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser.\r\n\r\nThe mission of _Our World in Data_ is to make data and research on the world\u2019s largest problems understandable and accessible. [Read more about our mission](https://ourworldindata.org/about).\r\n\r\nThe following documentation is taken from the Our World in Data [COVID-19 page](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data) and the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data):\r\n\r\nThe complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest.\r\n\r\n- **Confirmed cases and deaths:** our data comes from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) (ECDC). We discuss how and when the ECDC collects and publishes this data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily. *Note: the number of cases or deaths reported by any institution\u2014including the ECDC, the WHO, Johns Hopkins and others\u2014on a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date. This is because of the long reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. This also means that negative values in cases and deaths can sometimes appear when a country sends a correction to the ECDC, because it had previously overestimated the number of cases/deaths.*\r\n- **Testing for COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports; you can find further details in our post on COVID-19 testing, including our [checklist of questions to understand testing data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data), information on [geographical and temporal coverage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for), and [detailed country-by-country source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data). The testing dataset is updated around twice a week.\r\n- **Other variables:** this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Global Burden of Disease, Blavatnik School of Government, etc.). More information is available in [our codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-data-codebook.md).\r\n",

This data is currently only available for the US.\n\nThe DEX answers the question, for a smartphone residing in a given geography, how many distinct devices also visited any of the commercial venues that this device visited today?\n\nThe state-level (county-level) DEX reports the state-level average of this number across all devices residing in the state (county) that day. The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing pandemic, the DEX measure may be biased if devices sheltering-in-place are not in the sample due to lack of movement. We report adjusted DEX values to help address this selection bias. DEX-adjusted is computed assuming that the number of devices has not declined since the early-2020 peak and that unobserved devices did not visit any commercial venues.\n\nBoth the county and state level DEX have information on the number of devices in the sample and the adjusted DEX values as described above. Additionally, the state DEX has information in which the data has been separated into geographic regions that share demographic characteristics...\n\nThis data is produced by Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams with assistance from Hayden Parsley and Serena Xu.

    "description": "\n# Rest API\n\nThe REST API does not require any software to be installed on your computer, it allows you to\ninteract with our data through standard web protocols.\n\nOur API is build using [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/). For more information on the\ndifferent features of this API, please see their [documentation](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html).\n\n## API Key\n\nOur data is free and open for anyone to use (and always will be). Our team agreed that this was central to our mission when we agreed to begin this project. However, we do find it useful to have information about our users and to see how they use the data for two reasons:\n\n1. It helps us focus and improve the datasets that are seeing the most use.\n2. The number of users, as measured by active API keys, is one metric that we use to show that the\nproject is useful when we are discussing additional grant funding.\n\nWe are grateful to everyone who is willing to register for and use their API key when interacting\nwith our data.\n\nTo register for an API key, see the registration form [on our home page](https://covidcountydata.org#register).\n\nAfter obtaining an API key, please attach it as either the `apikey` header or query parameter in future requests\n\nFor example, if my API key were `abc123` and I was getting data from `https://api.covidcountydata.org/covid_us?fips=eq.6`, I\nwould adjust the url to be `https://api.covidcountydata.org/covid_us?fips=eq.6&apikey=abc123`\n\n\n## Request structure\n\nIn order to be able to request data, you will need to know which endpoint the data comes from and,\noptionally, which filters you would like to apply to the data before it's delivered:\n\n\n**API Endpoints**\n\nThe data in our database is broken into tables of related information with a separate endpoint for\neach table. For example, all of the U.S. COVID-19 related data is stored in the `covid_us` table\nand it has a corresponding endpoint of `https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us`. For a complete\nlist of the available endpoints, see the interactive playground near the bottom of the page.\n\n\n**Filters**\n\nThere are a two types of parameters that can be included as filters:\n\n* _Data parameters_: Data parameters are used to select subsets of the data by performing some\n  type of comparison between the parameter argument and the data.\n* _Keyword parameters_: Keyword parameters interact with how the data is returned. For example,\n  `select` can modify which columns are returned, `order` changes how the data is ordered when it\n  is returned, and `limit` changes the number of observations returned.\n\nThe data parameters that you are able to apply will depend on what columns are available in a\nparticular dataset. Many of the tables will have the columns `dt` (date of the obervation),\n`location` (a geographical identifier, for the U.S. this is often the fips code), `variable` (name\nof the variable being observed), and `value` (the value of the variable in that location at that\ntime).\n\nFor example, if you wanted to request 5 observations of the `tests_total` variable from after\nAugust 1, 2020 then you would use the following query:\n\n`https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us?dt=gt.2020-08-01&variable=eq.tests_total&limit=5`\n\nOf course, rather than input this address into your browser, you could query the API for this\ninformation using a more generic tool such as `curl` or `javascript`.\n\nWe make two additional observations:\n\n1. Rather than use `>`, `<`, `=`, etc..., the REST API expects you to use `gt.`, `lt.`, `eq.`,\n   etc... For a complete list of comparisons, see [PostgREST documentation](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html#operators)\n2. Much of the data is stored in _long form_ rather than _wide form_. In long form each data\n  observation, or value, is associated with its unique identifiers. For example, in many of our\n  datasets the identifiers are `dt`, `location`, and `variable`, and the value of the observation\n  is stored in `value`. This can be seen in the example section below.\n\n\n### Examples\n\nWe will do some examples to illustrate these points using the example table below. We will demonstrate\nthe example api requests using the `covid_us` endpoint (at https://api.covidcountydata.org/covid_us),\nbut the same concepts apply to all endpoints. Note that we will add `limit=20` to most of the requests\nbelow to prevent unnecessary data transfer, but removing this query parameter will allow you to fetch the\nwhole dataset. Finally, note also that we'll use the same `apikey=abc123` argument as shown in the\nexample above, but the `abc123` should be replaced by your API key.\n\nBelow is an example table showing the structure of the data returned by the `covid_us` endpoint:\n\n\n| dt         | fips | variable             | value  |\n| ---------- | ---- | -------------------- | ------ |\n| 2020-06-01 | 6    | deaths_total         | 4251   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 12   | deaths_total         | 2543   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 48   | deaths_total         | 1678   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 6    | deaths_total         | 4286   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 12   | deaths_total         | 2613   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 48   | deaths_total         | 1698   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 6    | positive_tests_total | 113006 |\n| 2020-06-01 | 12   | positive_tests_total | 56830  |\n| 2020-06-01 | 48   | positive_tests_total | 64880  |\n| 2020-06-02 | 6    | positive_tests_total | 115310 |\n| 2020-06-02 | 12   | positive_tests_total | 57447  |\n| 2020-06-02 | 48   | positive_tests_total | 66568  |\n\n\n### Only data from CA\n\nIn order to select data from only California (fips code 06) we filter the parameter `location` to\nonly be 6\n\n`https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us?fips=eq.06&limit=20&apikey=abc123`\n\n\n### Only observations with more than 100,000 tests\n\nIn order to only select observations with more than 100,000 tests, we would want to use the following parameters\n\n`https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us?variable=eq.positive_tests_total&value=gt.100000&limit=20&apikey=abc123`\n\n\n### Only observations after June 1, 2020\n\nIn order to only select the data from after June 1, 2020, we would use the following parameter\n\n`https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us?dt=gt.2020-06-01&limit=20&apikey=abc123`\n\n\n### Select total deaths for Texas ordered by date\n\nIn order to select only the total deaths variable for Texas and have the results be ordered by date, we would use the following parameters\n\n`https://api.covid.valorum.ai/covid_us?location=eq.48&variable=eq.positive_tests_total&order=dt&limit=20&apikey=abc123`\n\n\n## Software\n\nWe use the following open source technologies to build this API.\n\n* The data is hosted in a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n* The API is built using [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/)\n* The documentation is generated using [RapiDoc](https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/).\n\nWe are grateful to all of these projects for simplifying the task of building, deploying, and\ndocumenting our API. We are also grateful to Google Cloud for helping us host and distribute our\ndata.\n\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n",

Please see the [original source](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data) for more information.\r\n\r\nAll of Our World in Data is completely open access and all work is licensed under the Creative Commons BY license. You have the permission to use, distribute, and reproduce in any medium, provided the source and authors are credited.\r\n\r\nThis data has been collected, aggregated, and documented by Diana Beltekian, Daniel Gavrilov, Charlie Giattino, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Edouard Mathieu, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser.\r\n\r\nThe mission of _Our World in Data_ is to make data and research on the world\u2019s largest problems understandable and accessible. [Read more about our mission](https://ourworldindata.org/about).\r\n\r\nThe following documentation is taken from the Our World in Data [COVID-19 page](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data) and the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data):\r\n\r\nThe complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest.\r\n\r\n- **Confirmed cases and deaths:** our data comes from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) (ECDC). We discuss how and when the ECDC collects and publishes this data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily. *Note: the number of cases or deaths reported by any institution\u2014including the ECDC, the WHO, Johns Hopkins and others\u2014on a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date. This is because of the long reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. This also means that negative values in cases and deaths can sometimes appear when a country sends a correction to the ECDC, because it had previously overestimated the number of cases/deaths.*\r\n- **Testing for COVID-19:** this data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports; you can find further details in our post on COVID-19 testing, including our [checklist of questions to understand testing data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data), information on [geographical and temporal coverage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for), and [detailed country-by-country source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data). The testing dataset is updated around twice a week.\r\n- **Other variables:** this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Global Burden of Disease, Blavatnik School of Government, etc.). More information is available in [our codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-data-codebook.md).\r\n",

        "description": "The DEX, or device exposure index, is an index that measures how much movement there is within a particular geography (state or county). This data is currently only available for the US.\n\nThe DEX answers the question, for a smartphone residing in a given geography, how many distinct devices also visited any of the commercial venues that this device visited today?\n\nThe state-level (county-level) DEX reports the state-level average of this number across all devices residing in the state (county) that day. The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing pandemic, the DEX measure may be biased if devices sheltering-in-place are not in the sample due to lack of movement. We report adjusted DEX values to help address this selection bias. DEX-adjusted is computed assuming that the number of devices has not declined since the early-2020 peak and that unobserved devices did not visit any commercial venues.\n\nBoth the county and state level DEX have information on the number of devices in the sample and the adjusted DEX values as described above. Additionally, the state DEX has information in which the data has been separated into geographic regions that share demographic characteristics...\n\nThis data is produced by Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams with assistance from Hayden Parsley and Serena Xu.
