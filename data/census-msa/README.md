# Source data for MSAs

This directory contains a copy of data related to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).

The MSAs of the 1990s have led to the more modern Core-Based Statistical Areas and
consolidated metropolitan statistical areas. For more information see

The source file `list1_2020.xls` is from the
[Census.gov Delineation Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html).
It is parsed by code landing in the covid-data-model repo at `libs/datasets/statistical_areas.py`.
