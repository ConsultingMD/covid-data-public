# Sourced from states

This directory is a place to store copies of data sourced from various state governments and
groups.

In an effort to get more accurate information than is available in various aggregated sources
CovidActNow is gathering some data from sources that only cover a single state of the USA.
Ideally data is available as a timeseries in a machine readable format that we can copy here.
In some cases getting the best data involves working with a state agency to get their data into
Google Spreadsheet which is then copied to a CSV in this repo.

Sources include:

* The State of Kentucky
* The Nevada Hospital Association
