The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing pandemic, the DEX measure may be biased if devices sheltering-in-place are not in the sample due to lack of movement. We report adjusted DEX values to help address this selection bias. DEX-adjusted is computed assuming that the number of devices has not declined since the early-2020 peak and that unobserved devices did not visit any commercial venues.\n\nBoth the county and state level DEX have information on the number of devices in the sample and the adjusted DEX values as described above. Additionally, the state DEX has information in which the data has been separated into geographic regions that share demographic characteristics...\n\nThis data is produced by Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams with assistance from Hayden Parsley and Serena Xu.

    "description": "\nThis page provides documentation for the data available in the COVID Modeling Data Collaborative's database. It contains:\n\n1. A description of the different datasets, the variables in those datasets, and from where the datasets were sourced\n2. An interactive description of the API which describes the fields and allows you to submit sample requests\n\nIt is useful to note that the data is mostly stored in _long form_ rather than\n_wide form_. In long form each data observation, or value, is associated with\nits unique identifiers. For example, in many of our datasets the identifiers\nare `dt` (date of the observation), `fips` (geography of the observation), and\n`variable` (name of the variable being observed), and the value of the\nobservation is stored in `value`. This can be seen in the \n[table in the example subsection](##Examples).\n\n## Query Parameters\n\n\nThere are a two types of parameters that can be included in the queries:\n\n* _Data parameters_: Data parameters are used to select subsets of the data by performing some type of comparison between the parameter argument and the data.\n* _Keyword parameters_: Keyword parameters interact with how the data is returned. For example, `select` can modify which columns are returned, `order` changes how the data is ordered when it is returned, and `limit` changes the number of observations returned.\n\nBelow we will provide some examples for how to use the different types of parameters.\n\nOur API is build using [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/). For more information on the different features of our API, please see their [documentation](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html).\n\n## Examples\n\nWe will do some examples using the example table below:\n\n| dt         | fips | variable             | value  |\n| ---------- | ---- | -------------------- | ------ |\n| 2020-06-01 | 6    | deaths_total         | 4251   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 12   | deaths_total         | 2543   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 48   | deaths_total         | 1678   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 6    | deaths_total         | 4286   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 12   | deaths_total         | 2613   |\n| 2020-06-02 | 48   | deaths_total         | 1698   |\n| 2020-06-01 | 6    | positive_tests_total | 113006 |\n| 2020-06-01 | 12   | positive_tests_total | 56830  |\n| 2020-06-01 | 48   | positive_tests_total | 64880  |\n| 2020-06-02 | 6    | positive_tests_total | 115310 |\n| 2020-06-02 | 12   | positive_tests_total | 57447  |\n| 2020-06-02 | 48   | positive_tests_total | 66568  |\n\n\n### Only data from CA\n\nIn order to select data from only California (fips code 06) we would use the parameter\n\n* `fips=eq.06`\n\n\n### Only observations with more than 100,000 tests\n\nIn order to only select observations with more than 100,000 tests, we would want to use the following parameters\n\n* `variable=eq.positive_tests_total`\n* `value=gt.100000`\n\n\n### Only observations after June 1, 2020\n\nIn order to only select the data from after June 1, 2020, we would use the following parameter\n\n* `dt=gt.\"2020-06-01\"`\n\n\n### Select total deaths for Texas ordered by date\n\nIn order to select only the total deaths variable for Texas and have the results be ordered by date, we would use the following parameters\n\n* `fips=eq.48`\n* `variable=eq.positive_tests_total`\n* `order=dt`\n\n\n## Software\n\nWe use the following open source technologies for this API.\n\n* The data is hosted in a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n* The API is built using [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/)\n* The documentation is generated using [RapiDoc](https://mrin9.github.io/RapiDoc/).\n\nWe are grateful to all of these projects for simplifying the task of building, deploying, and documenting our API. We are also grateful to Google Cloud for helping us host and distribute our data.\n",

The DEX values are necessarily only a fraction of the number of distinct individuals that also visited any of the commercial venues visited by a device, since only a fraction of individuals, venues, and visits are in the device sample.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing pandemic, the DEX measure may be biased if devices sheltering-in-place are not in the sample due to lack of movement. We report adjusted DEX values to help address this selection bias. DEX-adjusted is computed assuming that the number of devices has not declined since the early-2020 peak and that unobserved devices did not visit any commercial venues.\n\nBoth the county and state level DEX have information on the number of devices in the sample and the adjusted DEX values as described above. Additionally, the state DEX has information in which the data has been separated into geographic regions that share demographic characteristics...\n\nThis data is produced by Victor Couture, Jonathan Dingel, Allison Green, Jessie Handbury, and Kevin Williams with assistance from Hayden Parsley and Serena Xu.
